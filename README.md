# KingdomTerrahearts
A mod for terraria that brings the Kingdom Hearts world into Terraria.
(We are not asociated with Keybrands+, but they are cool so you should check it out anyways)

### Important Notes:
-The code in this mod is not documented and won't be at least for a while.
-The organization of the mod is a mess, so good luck if you are trying to find something specific.
-New updates (of the mod or tmodloader) will break some parts of the previous code.
-Don't expect explanations from me about code, I just do whatever feels right, code is like my second language, except I speak it more fluently than any other language I know.
-All code here is licensed under the GPL v3 license. To keep it short, it is quite similar to the MIT license, but using our code requires you to open-source yours under the same license.
