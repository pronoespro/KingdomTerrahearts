Kingdom Terrahearts introduces the world of Kingdom Hearts to Terraria.

---Mod Contents---

-A special menu style (with custom music composed for this mod)
-7 brand new normal bosses, a multi-stage boss (gets more phases as you go along on your adventure), an event (the 1000 heartless battle), and 3 town npcs
-7 abilities, a "grappling hook" (athletic flow), a set of "wings" (faity dust)
-2 new weapon types and 1 new class (Keyblade master)
-A furniture set (twilight town based, block, walls, crafting table and poster), a huge tile (dive to heart) and a custom bed based on save spots in the KH franchise that fast forwards time.
-A party member system for all vanilla Terraria town npcs
-Fighting bosses on the dive to heart battleground unlocks harder versions of themselves that drop special loot (not really that much harder, but enough to be a nuisance)

DISCLAIMER: This mod is currently being developed for single player only. If you wish to play with other people do not use the npcs as party members unles you are ready for crazyness.

Mods that I got help from (some I just took part of the code):
-Collision Library from Seraph: thank you so much for the extra player collision script, it was really usefull for the Battling Heart fights.
