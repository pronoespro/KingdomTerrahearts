Kingdom Terrahearts is a mod that introduces the world of Kingdom Hearts to Terraria. It is currently 1 year old!
Requires the Subworld mod to work.

---Mod Contents---

-A special menu style (with custom music composed for this mod)
-7 brand new normal bosses, a multi-stage boss (gets more phases as you go along on your adventure), an event (the 1000 heartless battle), and 4 town npcs
-7 abilities, a "grappling hook" (athletic flow), a set of "wings" (faity dust)
-2 new weapon types and a new class (Keyblade master)
-1 Subworld (currently accessed by using Kairi's heart, just for testing)
-A furniture set (twilight town based, block, walls, crafting table and poster), a huge tile (dive to heart) and a custom bed based on save spots in the KH franchise that fast forwards time.
-A party member system for all vanilla Terraria town npcs
-Fighting bosses on the dive to heart battleground unlocks harder versions of themselves that drop special loot (not really that much harder, but enough to be a nuisance)

DISCLAIMER: This mod is currently being developed for single player only, so expect bugs if you play in multiplayer.

Mods that I got help from (some I just took part of the code):
-Collision Library from Seraph: thank you so much for the extra player collision script, it was really usefull for the Battling Heart fights.
-Subworld Library (for subworlds, they are really cool).
